/*
 * Write an algorithm and a program which prompts the user for the number of hours worked
 * and the hourly pay  rate.  The program should multiply hours and pay rate
 * and output the total pay to the screen.
 */

//Algorithm

//set up C++ program headers and main function able to do inputs and outputs

//Declare variables hoursWorked totalPay and payRate (able to hold decimal numbers)

//output messages to screen asking for number of hours worked and hourly pay rate

//Store user’s input from the keyboard in the hoursWorked variable

//Output messages to screen asking for the hourly pay rate

//Store user’s input from keyboard in the payRate variable

//After each message, store user’s inputs for hoursWorked and payRate in the hoursWorked and payRate variables

//Calculate totalPay using hoursWorked * payRate

//output total pay to the screen (with two decimal places of precision
